Simple Game App
=======

The backend of this Application is Built on NodeJS

The frontend is based on Angular 6

Some Dependencies such as mongoose and cors were used. I would list the complete dependencies later.

Intalling the Game App
=======

The game can be cloned or downloaded to the desired folder.

Create a .env file at the root folder with the following variable
    App Port
    App env
    Db URi
    DB Username
    Db Password
    
Run 'npm install' in the command-line to install dependencies

Run 'npm start' in the command-line to start the application

This documentation would be made better in the future
